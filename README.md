Project Functionality:
======================
The program takes in the file name of an intercal program 
and calculates if the program contains the proper number of 
"pleases" (between 1/4 and 1/3 the number of lines). 

The user is then notified as to how many more/fewer pleases
are needed for the intercal program to compile correctly. 

Attached is the program, along with three text files that
can be used to test the program.


Project Grading Rubric:
=======================
+10pts if it compiles
+10pts if it does what you intended
+10pts if it does something cool
+10pts if you opensource the code online (GitHub, etc)
